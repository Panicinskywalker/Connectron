This is a connect 4 style game that I was assigned as homework
It can be played by 1-10 players with a computer player included for 1 player games
There is a custom line length to win and a best of feature
In addition there is a special mode where each player can use a bomb counter, this counter will destroy all the counters in the immediate vicinity upon landing. Only used once per player.

*Ignore the fast that it was originally called Connectron_GUI_testing, I ended up just creating the whole thing in it
